                <p>Software as a Service is a method of providing applications over the internet. This 
                means that a user can easily access the software online without installing it on 
                PC. There are several advantages associated with SaaS for business;
                <br/>
                <br/>  
                Easy upgrades: Upgrades deployed centrally to the hosted application therefore the 
                user of the software does not have to complete the upgrade
                <br/>
                Easily Accessible: All you need is an internet access to use software.
                <br/>
                Low setup cost: For a business capital does not have to be invested in hardware
                you instead purchase what you require from the service.

                <p>Infrastructure as a Service provides virtualised hardware i.e. computing infrastructure. Similar to 
                SaaS and PaaS, IaaS can be used by business to cost efficient and easily scalable IT infrastructures, 
                while outsourcing the procurement and maintenance of any hardware to the service provider.
