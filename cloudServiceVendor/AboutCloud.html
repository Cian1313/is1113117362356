            <p>Software as a Service is a method of providing applications over the internet. This 
            means that a user can easily access the software online without installing it on 
            PC. There are several advantages associated with SaaS for business;
            <br/>
            <br/>  
            Easy upgrades: Upgrades deployed centrally to the hosted application therefore the 
            user of the software does not have to complete the upgrade
            <br/>
            Easily Accessible: All you need is an internet access to use software.
            <br/>
            Low setup cost: For a business capital does not have to be invested in hardware
            you instead purchase what you require from the service.
            <br/>
            <br/>

            <p>Infrastructure as a Service provides virtualised hardware i.e. computing infrastructure. Similar to 
            SaaS and PaaS, IaaS can be used by business to cost efficient and easily scalable IT infrastructures, 
            while outsourcing the procurement and maintenance of any hardware to the service provider.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Amazon Web Services (AWS) is an example of a provider of IaaS.  AWS provided a wide range of service 
            such as storage, database, analytics and deployment services in the aim to aid firms in lowering IT 
            costs, be more efficient and the ability to scale applications as the business grows.

            <p>Communication as a Service delivers SaaS for communications. CaaS providers include Skype (video 
            conferencing) and perhaps most importantly Gmail (email).  
            <br/>   
            <br/>
            The use of CaaS (implemented through Gmail for example) in industry can lead to more effective and 
            efficient communication between employees as they can share information instantly and easily.
