            <p>Software as a Service is a method of providing applications over the internet. This 
                means that a user can easily access the software online without installing it on 
                PC. There are several advantages associated with SaaS for business;
            </p> 
                <ul>
                    <li>Easy upgrades: Upgrades deployed centrally to the hosted application therefore the 
                        user of the software does not have to complete the upgrade
                    </li>
                    <li>Easily Accessible: All you need is an internet access to use software.</li>
                    <li>Low setup cost: For a business capital does not have to be invested in hardware
                        you instead purchase what you require from the service.
                    </li>
                </ul>	 
             <p>   Salesforce is an example of business that provides Software as a Service. Salesforces main 
                revenue comes from its customer relationship management product. However they also provide other
                application such as Heroku, which is a Platform as a Service (PaaS)
            </p>
            
        <h3>Platform as a Service (PaaS)</h3>
        <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloud9/">
            <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f7/Cloud9_logo.svg/1200px-Cloud9_logo.svg.png" alt="C9 Logo" height="125" width="225" align="right">
        </a>
        <p>Platform as a Service is a method of providing cloud computing applications over the internet. This
           means that a user can develop and run applications without downloading software and files. 
            <br/>
            <br/>
           Cloud 9 which is provided by Amazon Web Service is an example of a PaaS. Cloud 9 is describes as a 
           cloud-based IDE. The advantages of using this service provided by AWS include;
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>The ability to code with just a browser and an internet connection.</li>
            <li>The ability to code with others in real time making working in teams more efficient.</li>
            <li>The ability to start new project quickly in a wide a variety of programming languages.</li>
        </ul>
        
        
        <h3>Infrastructure as a Service</h3>
        <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/">
            <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1d/AmazonWebservices_Logo.svg/2000px-AmazonWebservices_Logo.svg.png" alt="AWS Logo" height="125" width="225" align="right"/>
        </a>
        <p>Infrastructure as a Service provides virtualised hardware i.e. computing infrastructure. Similar to 
           SaaS and PaaS, IaaS can be used by business to cost efficient and easily scalable IT infrastructures, 
           while outsourcing the procurement and maintenance of any hardware to the service provider.
            <br/>
            <br/>
           Amazon Web Services (AWS) is an example of a provider of IaaS.  AWS provided a wide range of service 
           such as storage, database, analytics and deployment services in the aim to aid firms in lowering IT 
           costs, be more efficient and the ability to scale applications as the business grows.
        </p>
        
        
        <h3>Commmunication as a Service</h3>

        </a>
        <p>Communication as a Service delivers SaaS for communications. CaaS providers include Skype (video 
           conferencing) and perhaps most importantly Gmail (email).  
            <br/>   
            <br/>
           The use of CaaS (implemented through Gmail for example) in industry can lead to more effective and 
           efficient communication between employees as they can share information instantly and easily.
